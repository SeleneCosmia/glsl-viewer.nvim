# `glslView-nvim`

When editing GLSL shaders,
  this plugin provides the command `GlslView` which will open 
  [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer)
  to the file being edited in the current buffer.
It is opened with the `-l` flag so that `glslViewer` will automatically listen
  for file changes,
  updating the preview as you save.

## üì¶ Installation
Install the plugin with your preferred package manager.
For example,
  in [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) simply:

```lua
  use { 'timtro/glslView-nvim', ft = 'glsl' }
```
Don't forget to `PackerCompile` after installation so that the plugin will only
  be loaded for glsl files.

### Installing `glslViewer`
See [installation](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer/wiki/Installing)
  in the glslViewer Wiki.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
  * Not yet implemented.
  * The only configuration features planned will allow setting the executable 
      file path for glslViewer‚Äîso no big rush until someone tells me they need
      this.

## üí™ Usage
Simply use the command `:GlslView` to open the current buffer in glslViewer.

## üß∞ Alternatives
 * [vim-GlslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/vim-glslViewer) -
    Version drift seems to have rendered it useless (at this time) since it
    laucnes the process with `&` to free up the UI, but this causes glslViewer
    to stop rendering (and then in my case, close).
